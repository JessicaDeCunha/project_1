## Impact of COVID-19: A Comparative Portfolio Analysis

### Project Description:

As the Global pandemic continues to create uncertainity, the aim of this project is to study the Impact of COVID-19 so far on the stock market and portfolio earnings. The global stock markets started with a sharp decline when WHO announced the coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic in early March but have since recovered.

With all the negative news around COVID-19 our attempt is to investigate if there is a positive impact on portfolio earnings between January 2019 to June 2020. The 18 month timeframe has been chosen to represent pre COVID-19 to present time. 

Our project starts first with a custom portfolio of 5 dividend paying stocks chosen from a list of top 25 S&P 500 companies. Second, this portfolio is compared with a Fintech ETF representing the sector showing tremendous potential for growth due to the increase in use of digital financial services and e-commerce. Last, the S&P 500 Index is used as a benchmark for assessing trends in the stock market.

### Questions Posed for Analysis

1. What is the Impact of COVID 19 on the stock market?

2. What is the effect of COVID 19 on the sectors represented in the custom portfolio?

3. How has COVID19 affected the Fintech space?

4. What are the key takeaways from the analysis of portfolio stocks, Fintech ETF and the overall market?
